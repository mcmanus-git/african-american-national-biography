#### Overview
The [Enslaved People in the African American National Biography, 1508-1865](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FIEYGJ) 
dataset is derived from the [African American National Biography](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/AANB) 
by [Steven J. Niven](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/people/steven-j-niven) and contains records of over 1,300 
people who lived prior to ratification of The 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution between the 
years 1508-1865.
<br>
#### Considerations While Exploring this Data  

While exploring the visualizations on the home page, please keep in mind this is but a subset of all African 
American people living during this time and includes records of approximately 1,300 people. Of these 
1,300 records, many are incomplete. As such, it is impossible to make 
concrete inferences between these accounts and what life may have been truly like for African Americans
during this time in aggregate.  
<br>
For instance, you'll notice in the visualization below that 651 individuals have been recorded as 
having ever been enslaved. Of the 1,300 records, this is roughly 50%. It is unlikely this is an accurate
 ratio as, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database estimates, 388,000 Africans were 
transported directly to the United States to be sold as slaves 
[[1]](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/). 
As you can see, 1,300 biographies of African Americans during the same time period is only 0.3% of just
those who were transported to the United States directly from Africa. Therefore, it is unsafe to assume 
the same ratios will be applicable universally.  
<br>
#### Data Cleaning and Presentation

As records were hand recorded, significant data cleaning was necessary to enable aggregation of information found 
therein. All data cleaning methods are documented in a 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mcmanus-git/african-american-national-biography/blob/main/data_pipelines/data%20cleaning%20eda.ipynb) 
hosted in the 
[Project Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mcmanus-git/african-american-national-biography) 
as well as both the 
[raw dataset](https://github.com/mcmanus-git/african-american-national-biography/blob/main/data/AANB-Data-Final-Revised20210414.csv) 
and the 
[cleaned dataset](https://github.com/mcmanus-git/african-american-national-biography/blob/main/data/aanb_data_clean.pkl)
 for reference and reproducibility. Data contents and dictionary are explained fully in the 
 [documentation](https://github.com/mcmanus-git/african-american-national-biography/blob/main/data/AANB-Documentation-Final20201221.xlsx).
