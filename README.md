> "The 'Enslaved People in the African American National Biography, 1508-1865' dataset builds on the complete print and 
> online collection of the African American National Biography (AANB), edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Evelyn 
> Brooks Higginbotham. The full collection contains over 6,000 biographical entries of named historical individuals, 
> including 1,304 for subjects born before 1865 and the abolition of slavery in the United States. In making a subset 
> of biographical entries from the multivolume work, the goal was to extract life details from those biographies into 
> an easy-to-view database form that details whether a subject was enslaved for some or all of their lives and to 
> provide the main biographical details of each subject for contextual analysis and comparison. 52 fields covering 
> location data; gender; names, alternate names and suffixes; dates and places of birth and death; and up to 8 
> occupations were included. We also added 13 unique fields that provide biographical details on each subject: 
> Free born in North America; Free before 13th Amendment; Ever Enslaved; How was freedom attained; Other/uncertain 
> status; African born; Parent information; Runaways and rebels; Education/literacy; Religion; Slave narrative or 
> memoir author; Notes; and Images" (Niven, Steven J., 2021).
